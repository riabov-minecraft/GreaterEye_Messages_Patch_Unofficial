# Greater Eye RU Patch (Unofficial)

A small client-side add-on for **Minecraft Forge 1.19.2** that provides a complete Russian translation for **Greater Eye of Ender** (NeoForge/Forge).

This patch covers not only normal localization keys, but also text that is **hardcoded** in the original mod and therefore can’t be translated through standard language files.

## Requirements
- Minecraft **1.19.2**
- **Forge** (1.19.2)
- **Greater Eye of Ender** (NeoForge/Forge)

## How it works
- The patch is **client-only** (no server install required).
- It activates **only** when the game language is set to **Russian (ru_ru)**.
- On any other language, it does **nothing** and does not alter the original mod’s behavior.
- To avoid conflicts, it only rewrites text that is clearly related to Greater Eye (tooltips and the mod’s own system messages).

## Installation
1. Install Forge for Minecraft 1.19.2.
2. Install **Greater Eye of Ender**.
3. Drop this mod jar into your `mods` folder.
4. In Minecraft, set the language to **Русский (ru_ru)**.

## Compatibility
- Safe to use in modpacks.
- Does not modify game files.
- Does not touch player chat and avoids rewriting unrelated messages.

## License
